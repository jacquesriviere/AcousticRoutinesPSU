function [max_interpolation,timedelay] = delay(X,ts)

% X is the result of the xcorr function. ts is sampling time (= 1/fs).

% This function finds the maximum of the intercorrelation function X, and
% refines the maximum by fitting a parabola passing through the maximum and
% the two adjacent points, allowing one to get a more precise time delay.

% NN is the length of the signal you want to analyze. The intercorrelation function
% has a length equal to 2*NN-1.

NN = (length(X)+1)/2;
tps = -(NN-1)*ts:ts:(NN-1)*ts;

[maxi,ind] = max(X);

% parabolic interpolation around the max
x1 = ind - 1; x2 = ind; x3 = ind + 1;

% this loop prevents the routine from bugging when the max is found on the
% edges
if x1 == 0 % if the maximum happens to be at the very first point (if you have a noisy waveform and you are very unlucky for instance) 
    x1 = 1; % arbitrarily choose the maximum at x2 = 2;
    x2 = 2; 
    x3 = 3;
    ind = 2;
elseif x3 == length(X) + 1 % if the maximum happens to be at the very last point (if you have a noisy waveform and you are very unlucky for instance)
    x1 = length(X) - 2; % arbitrarily choose the maximum at x2 = length(X) - 1;
    x2 = length(X) - 1; 
    x3 = length(X);
    ind = length(X) - 1; 
end    

% Loop from lines 22 - 32 do not assign y1...y3 to anything. So, if the lines 35 - 37 are inside the else portion, they aren't
% created when x1 == 0 or x3 == length(X) + 1. This causes an error when line 41 is compiled.

y1 = X(x1);
y2 = X(x2);
y3 = X(x3);


b = ((y1 - y3)*(x1^2 - x2^2) - (y1 - y2)*(x1^2 - x3^2))/...
    ((x1 - x3)*(x1^2 - x2^2) - (x1 - x2)*(x1^2 - x3^2));
a = (y1 - y3 - b*(x1 - x3))/(x1^2 - x3^2);
c = y1 - a*x1^2 - b*x1;

ind_max_corr = -b/(2*a);
